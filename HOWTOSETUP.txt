1. Make a copy of your skeleton directory. Name it after your new project

2. Rename (move) the NAME module to be the name of your project or whatever you want to call your root module.

3. Edit your setup.py to have all the information for your project.

4. Rename tests/NAME_tests.py to also have your module name.

5. Double check it's all working by using 'nosetests' from the CLI in skeleton/ again.

6. Start coding.

7. Put a script in the bin directory that you run, and mention it in the setup.py so it gets installed.

8. Use setup.py to install your own module to make sure that it works, and use pip to uninstall it.
